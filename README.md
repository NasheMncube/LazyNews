# LazyNews

Lazy news is a small script which collects news links based on key search terms using the Google. The script runs continously
in the background. 

This was a small personal project to practice using the Google custom search API and to give myself a little tool when it comes 
to searching for news topics in my spare time.

To use personally, the user must obtain their own API key and setup a custom search. Instructions to 
use the Google custom search API are here

Feel free to fork and use.
